## 🧮 Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

**Filename:** `Task1.py`

### Description:
This script:
- Defines a function named `factorial` that takes an integer input.
- Computes the factorial using either a loop or recursion.
- Returns the calculated factorial.
- Calls the function with a sample value and prints the result.

### Sample Output:
Enter a number: 5
The factorial of 5 is: 120

## 📐 Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

**Filename:** `Task2.py`

### Description:
This script:
- Accepts a numeric input from the user.
- Uses Python's `math` module to compute:
  - Square root of the number
  - Natural logarithm (base e)
  - Sine of the number (in radians)
- Displays the results with proper formatting.

### Sample Output:
Enter a number: 25
Square root: 5.0
Natural logarithm: 3.2188758248682006
Sine (in radians): -0.13235175009777303
